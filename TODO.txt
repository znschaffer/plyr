Skip over malformatted audio files

- taglib breaks when it see's them
- waveform visualization would be nice
  get pcm frames from miniaudio seems to be a problem
  but we should be able to use a ImGui Plot to show the waveform and scrub through it.

- albums should drop down with their songs?

  is this complicating the album view? should it just be albums?


- make use of more ImGui functions like context menus - maybe a top menu for configuration etc etc

  make it feel like a real app!


- click on item in queue to jump to it

- Repeat toggle

- Shuffle mode

- auto add to playqueue mode that either takes a random song or another from the album / artist
